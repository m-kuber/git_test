"As flies to wanton boys are we to the gods,
they kill us for their sport. Soon the science 
will not only be able to slow down the aging of 
the cells, soon the science will fix the cells to
the state and so we will become eternal. Only
accidents, crimes, wars, will still kill us but 
unfortunately, crimes, wars, will multiply. I 
love football. Thank you."
                        - Eric Cantona
